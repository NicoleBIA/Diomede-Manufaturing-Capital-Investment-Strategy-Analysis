## Insight #1: Southeast Asia Market Prioritization  
- **What I Found:** Vietnam outperformed other Southeast Asian markets in stability, manufacturing infrastructure, and skilled labor availability, especially in electronics and consumer goods.  
- **Why It Matters:** Location influences cost structure, logistics, and long-term ROI. Indonesia offered larger volume potential but with higher volatility.  
- **Strategy I Recommended:** Prioritize Vietnam for phased investment with option to scale into Indonesia later via licensing or partnerships.

## Insight #2: Greenfield vs. Partnership Investment  
- **What I Found:** While Greenfield investment provides full operational control, it requires higher upfront CapEx and carries longer runway to breakeven.  
- **Why It Matters:** Rapid market entry may be more feasible through licensing or regional partnerships.  
- **Strategy I Recommended:** Use a hybrid entry model — Greenfield for flagship presence, plus licensing to test peripheral markets.

## Insight #3: Product-Channel Optimization  
- **What I Found:** Demand forecasting identified strongest traction for power tools and electrical fixtures.  
- **Why It Matters:** Not all products will perform equally in new markets. Aligning with local demand minimizes excess inventory and pricing mismatches.  
- **Strategy I Recommended:** Lead with high-demand tools, stagger the rollout of heavier industrial equipment to reduce launch risk.

## 🔐 Insight #4: Risk & Scenario Modeling  
- **What I Found:** Currency fluctuation, political stability, and infrastructure disruption ranked highest in risk simulation models.  
- **Why It Matters:** Reputational, regulatory, and financial risk varies widely by country.  
- **Strategy I Recommended:** Include hedging strategies, phased CapEx rollout, and in-country compliance specialists in expansion budget.
